    ### Install library

    ```cmd
    yarn add react-native-unistyles
    ```


    ### Define your theme

    You don't have to follow a specific format. Just make an object and add any keys/values you like.

    ```ts
    // theme.ts
    export const theme = {
      colors: {
        blood: '#eb4d4b',
        barbie: '#e056fd',
        pumpkin: '#f0932b',
        background: '#ffffff'
      },
      margins: {
        sm: 2,
        md: 4,
        lg: 8,
        xl: 12
      }
    } as const
    ```

    or something more advanced with nested objects / functions:

    ```ts
    // theme.ts
    export const theme = {
      colors: {
        blood: '#eb4d4b',
        barbie: '#e056fd',
        pumpkin: '#f0932b',
        background: '#ffffff'
      },
      components: {
        typography: {
          bold: {
            fontWeight: 'bold'
          },
          thin: {
            fontWeight: '300'
          }
        }
      },
      margins: {
        sm: 2,
        md: 4,
        lg: 8,
        xl: 12
      },
      utils: {
        hexToRGBA: (hex: string, opacity: number) => {
          const rgb = hex
            .replace('#', '')
            .split(/(?=(?:..)*$)/)
            .map(x => parseInt(x, 16))
          return `rgba(${rgb.at(0)}, ${rgb.at(1)}, ${rgb.at(2)}, ${opacity})`
        }
      }
    } as const
    ```

    It's good to add "as const" to the end of your theme object to make sure TypeScript knows it's a constant object and not a mutable one. It also allows you to spread your partial theme object into a full theme object without TypeScript complaining.

    ### Create breakpoints

    There are no predefined breakpoints. You can name them anything. Just make an object with string keys and number values.

    ```ts
    // breakpoints.ts
    export const breakpoints = {
        xs: 0,
        sm: 576,
        md: 768,
        lg: 992,
        xl: 1200,
        superLarge: 2000,
        tvLike: 4000
    } as const
    ```

    It's good to add "as const" to the end of your breakpoints object to make sure TypeScript knows it's a constant object and not a mutable one.

    ### Wrap your app with UnistylesTheme to inject theme

    ```tsx
    import React from 'react'
    import { UnistylesTheme } from 'react-native-unistyles'
    import { theme } from './theme'

    export const App: React.FunctionComponent = () => (
      <UnistylesTheme theme={theme}>
        // Your App
      </UnistylesTheme>
    )
    ```

    ### Access createStyleSheet and useStyles with a factory

    ```ts
    // styles.ts

    // import library factory
    import { createUnistyles } from 'react-native-unistyles'
    // import your breakpoints, add whatever keys and numeric values you want
    import { breakpoints } from './breakpoints'
    // import your app's theme TypeScript type, or simply use 'typeof theme'
    import { theme } from './theme'

    export const {
        createStyleSheet,
        useStyles,
    } = createUnistyles<typeof breakpoints, typeof theme>(breakpoints)
    ```
