title: Migrate from StyleSheet
---

`react-native-unistyles` embraces the simplicity of `StyleSheet`, making it easy to integrate into your project.

You can replace `StyleSheet.create` with `createStyleSheet` and it will work exactly the same:

```diff
-const styles = StyleSheet.create({
+const styles = createStyleSheet({
    scrollContainer: {
        flex: 1,
        justifyContent: 'center',
        alignItems: 'center',
    }
})
```

If you need additional functionalities such as `breakpoints`, `media-queries` or `theme` you can incrementally pass `style(sheet)` into the `useStyles` hook:

```ts
export const ExampleUnistyles = () => {
  const { styles } = useStyles(stylesheet)
  // ... your component code
}
```

With the hook in place, you can now use all the features.
