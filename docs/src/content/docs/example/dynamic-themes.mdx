You can incorporate as many themes as you desire in your application. While there's flexibility in how you structure your theme, it's essential to maintain consistency with the TypeScript type:

To promote reusability and maintainability, it's a good practice to share as many values between themes as possible:

```ts
// move shared colors to object
const sharedColors = {
    barbie: '#ff9ff3',
    oak: '#1dd1a1',
    sky: '#48dbfb',
    fog: '#c8d6e5',
    aloes: '#00d2d3'
}

export const lightTheme = {
    colors: {
        // reuse or override them
        ...sharedColors,
        backgroundColor: '#ffffff',
        typography: '#000000'
    }
    // other keys in common with darkTheme
}

export const darkTheme = {
    colors: {
        // reuse or override them
        ...sharedColors,
        backgroundColor: '#000000',
        typography: '#ffffff'
    }
    // other keys in common with lightTheme
}

// export type that will be used to describe your theme
export type AppTheme = typeof lightTheme | typeof darkTheme
```

With the themes set up, modify your  `createUnistyles` to consume your `AppTheme` type:

```ts
export const { useStyles, createStyleSheet } = createUnistyles<typeof breakpoints, AppTheme>(breakpoints)
```

The final step is to switch your theme based on certain states, persisted values, databases, etc.:

```tsx
export const App: React.FunctionComponent = () => {
    // obtain here your dark or light theme. It can be storage, state, mmkv, or whateber you use
    // const [yourAppTheme] = useState(lightTheme)
    // const [yourAppTheme] = useYourStorage()
    // const [yourAppTheme] = useMMKVObject<AppTheme>(Theme)

    // switching theme will re-render your stylesheets automatically
    return (
        <UnistylesTheme theme={yourAppTheme}>
            <Examples.Extreme />
        </UnistylesTheme>
    )
}
```

</Seo>
