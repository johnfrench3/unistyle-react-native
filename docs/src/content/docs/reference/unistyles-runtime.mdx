Unistyles Runtime is the most powerful part of Unistyles 2.0. 
It replaces much of the functionality previously handled by the React Native API. It also keeps track of your device dimensions, orientation, theme, preferred scheme, etc.

You can interact with Unistyles via `Unistyles Runtime` in your code.

:::tip
Unistyles Runtime is a Host Object (created in C++). It's always up to date and allows you to interact with the native side of Unistyles.
:::

## Usage

You can import `UnistylesRuntime` from `react-native-unistyles`:

```tsx /UnistylesRuntime/
import { UnistylesRuntime } from 'react-native-unistyles'
```

and use it anywhere in your code, even outside a component.

## Getters

| themeName | string | Name of the selected theme or an empty string if you don't use themes |
| breakpoint | string / undefined | Current breakpoint or always undefined if you don't use breakpoints |

### Why doesn't `UnistylesRuntime` re-render my component?

You should think of `UnistylesRuntime` as a JavaScript object. 
It's not a React component, so it doesn't re-render your component when, for example, screen size or breakpoint changes.

### How to re-render my stylesheets based on `UnistylesRuntime`?

If you use `UnistylesRuntime` in your `createStyleSheet` it will automatically re-render your styles to get the perfect styles in real-time.

One example could be reading device width and height. Using `Dimensions` from React Native won't work as intended, as it will always return the same value.

```tsx /UnistylesRuntime/
import { UnistylesRuntime, createStyleSheet } from 'react-native-unistyles'

// your component

const stylesheet = createStyleSheet(theme => ({
    container: {
        backgroundColor: theme.colors.background,
        width: UnistylesRuntime.screen.width,
        height: UnistylesRuntime.screen.height
    }
}))
```

:::tip
Your stylesheets will only be re-rendered on a few changes in Unistyles Runtime:
- screen size changes
- orientation changes
- breakpoint changes
