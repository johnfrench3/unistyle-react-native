`useStyle` ties everything together and handles the heavy lifting. Without `useStyles`, you can't utilize features like:
- breakpoints
- media queries
- themes

_useStyles_ allows you to skip the `stylesheet` if you only want to access the `theme`:

```tsx
const { theme } = useStyles()
```

For more advanced usage, pass your `stylesheet` generated with `createStyleSheet`:

```tsx
// you can still access theme
const { styles, theme } = useStyles(stylesheet)
```
