Debugging Unistyles depends on the platform you are using.
Some older methods of debugging may no longer work.
Follow this guide to learn how to debug for your specific platform.

### Bare React Native / macOS

If you are using bare React Native, you can use the new [React Native Debugger](https://reactnative.dev/docs/debugging).
You can also use native tooling like Xcode or Android Studio.

:::caution
Flipper has been [deprecated](https://reactnative.dev/docs/debugging?js-debugger=flipper#opening-the-debugger) and is not supported by Unistyles.
:::

:::caution
Unistyles contains JSI code, so debugging with Chrome DevTools is not possible.

Chrom DevTools have been [deprecated](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/discussions/734) and are no longer supported by React Native as well.
:::

### Expo

For Expo, you can use the [Expo DevTools](https://docs.expo.dev/debugging/tools/) or the debugger for React Native.

:::tip[How to open the debugger?]
Press the `j` key on the terminal where you started the Expo server.
:::

### Web

For web applications, you can use the browser's DevTools.

### SSR

If you are using SSR, you can utilize the browser's DevTools / NodeJS tooling.

### Other ways

If you are unsure how to debug, you can always use `console.log` to log values to the console.
