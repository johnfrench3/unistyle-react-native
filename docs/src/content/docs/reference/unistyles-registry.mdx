UnistylesRegistry is a singleton that allows you to register `themes`, `breakpoints` and pass additional `config`.

:::tip
You should call `UnistylesRegistry` only once in your application. If you want to interact with `Unistyles` during runtime use [UnistylesRuntime](/reference/unistyles-runtime/) instead.
:::

There is no required timing for when you should call it. It can be done, for example, in your `App.tsx` file or somewhere deeper.
