Unistyles offers first-class support for `React Native Web`. 
No additional configuration is needed to use it. Your stylesheets will function identically on both mobile and web platforms.

### CSS Media Queries

By default, Unistyles will re-evaluate your media queries in JavaScript. However, there is an option to delegate this responsibility to the browser using CSS Media Queries.

To enable this feature, set `experimentalCSSMediaQueries` to `true` in your [UnistylesRegistry](/reference/unistyles-registry/).

:::caution
This feature is experimental and might not work in all cases. It was developed to showcase a preview of what Unistyles 3.0 will be capable of.
